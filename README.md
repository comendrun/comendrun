# I can't even believe that I have come this far and I'm grateful for everything.

## ## How Did I Start Learning about Web Development?

I always wanted to work with computers. throughout my childhood, learning Photoshop, Corel Draw, working as a typist, translator, and etc. and also trying to make apps and themes for Symbian OS-based Nokia Mobile phones, I always wanted to make things happen in the digital world. I was far from computers for a couple of years since I went to university and then I realized, why I didn't even try to pursue what I always wanted to do?
so I decided to start with web development and after a couple of months, I realized that it was the only thing that I want to do. I cant feel the padding of time when I'm in flow state coding. That's something I never experienced before. I even wished my days to be more than 24 hours so maybe I could code a little more. but anyways, I have experienced this feeling and I don't think anything could take this feeling and this joy away from me again.

## A little bit about myself

I'm Kamran and I am a couple of months old in this new beautiful digital world. I've studied Dental Technology at university and also had a couple of years of experience in that field. but after all, it wasn't something I wanted from bottom of my heart. so I decided to go for this and I hope I can land my first tech job with hard work and my best attitude.

## What am I doing right now:

- I'm working on frontend Mentor challenges
- I'm focusing on finishing "The Frontend Developer Career Path" course by great Scrimba. I can not emphasize how much I'm grateful to this wonderful community and this website.
- I'm trying to build a portfolio website and also a resume and start applying for my first ever tech job.
- I'm looking for help with getting a job.
